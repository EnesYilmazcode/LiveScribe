# LiveScribe

LiveScribe is a computer vision project that recognizes handwritten math expressions from a drawing canvas and evaluates them.

The goal is to explore symbol recognition, segmentation, and expression parsing using deep learning, while keeping the system interactive and easy to experiment with.

## Current Features

- Handwritten input via a drawing canvas  
- Image preprocessing for symbol recognition  
- GPU-accelerated deep learning setup using CUDA and PyTorch 

## Planned Features

- Symbol segmentation (digits and operators)  
- Handwritten math expression parsing  
- Real-time or on-submit evaluation  
- Confidence visualization and error analysis  

## Tech Stack

- Python  
- PyTorch / Torchvision  
- OpenCV  
- NumPy  
- Gradio  

## Setup

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
